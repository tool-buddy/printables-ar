# Contributing to Printables AR

Hi. Thank you for considering contributing to Printables AR.

Feel free to enhance any part of this application. I have listed several possible enhancements on the [Issues page](https://github.com/tool-buddy/printables-ar/issues). You may choose to work on one of them if you wish.
For now, I am keeping these contribution guidelines very simple: Please open a pull request for each contribution. I may provide further guidelines in the future if this project gains enough contributors.

Have a nice day.
